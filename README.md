# Sliding Puzzle with animations


## TODO:
- [x] Add animations
- [x] I know this defeats the whole point of the thing, but I added numbers in the corner of each square
- [x] Fix weird stuff happening when I set `DIM = 9` (could also be for other values, just I noticed it for 9)
    - Not really any fix to it, I just reckon it happens due to divisibility issues between the dimensions of the image and DIM
